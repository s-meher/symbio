> **A crowdsourced, community-oriented loan platform** where borrowers and lenders are verified members of the *same geographic community* — using ID verification to build real trust.  
> Lenders bid the lowest rate they’re willing to accept, borrowers pick their amount, and our algorithm stitches together multiple offers to fund the exact need.

## 💡 Why Symbio Is a Game Changer

| Problem | Symbio’s Solution |
|----------|------------------|
| **Predatory fintechs (Klarna, Afterpay)** prey on low-income users with 30%+ APRs | **Hard cap at average bank rate (9.5%)** — no loan can exceed this |
| **Opaque P2P lending** with hidden fees and high risk | **Full transparency**: every rate, fee, and match is visible |
| **Borrowers overextend** due to poor financial literacy | **AI (Grok) + Knot API** analyze spending habits and **deny financially irresponsible loans** |
| **Money leaves communities**, flowing from poorer areas to richer ones | **ID verification** ensures lenders and borrowers within a community benefit each other |

> **Financial justice, powered by AI and community.**

## 🧠 How It Works

📊 **(DIAGRAM GOES HERE)**  
*Community Lending → ID Verification → AI Vetting → Multi-Lender Match → Transparent Repayment*

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React (Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)  
**Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
**APIs:** Knot, Grok, X 
**Database:** SQL Lite

## 🧩 Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symbio.git
cd symbio
````

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and edit as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**.env example:**

```bash
KNOT_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
X_API_KEY=
BANK_AVG_RATE=9.5
```

---

## 🚀 Backend Setup (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

> ⚠️ The API keeps everything in memory, so restarting the server clears users, matches, and posts.
> CORS is open for `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 💻 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React app (Vite) runs on port 3000 and expects the backend on 8000. Routes mirror the storyboard order, store the active user in `localStorage`, and use Tailwind + shadcn/ui for styling.

To pull in additional shadcn/ui primitives:

```bash
cd frontend
npx shadcn-ui add <component>
```

## Optional integrations

- **Purchase linking + Grok scoring**: Drop your Knot mock data (already in `backend/app/knot_mock_data/`) and set `GROK_API_KEY` / `GROK_MODEL` so `/borrow/risk` calls xAI Grok with real transaction summaries.
- **X/Twitter feed**: Set `X_API_KEY` (Bearer token). The backend exposes `GET /x/feed?handle=raymo8980`, which the Community Feed page uses to display the latest tweets inline with community posts.
- **X auto-sharing**: To broadcast successful matches from a shared account, also set `X_CONSUMER_KEY`, `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. After `/loans/request` succeeds, the backend signs a `POST /2/tweets` call so borrowers see “Shared with @raymo8980” plus a link to the feed.
